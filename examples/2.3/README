The pressures are negative as a result of the poor k-point and basis set convergence. But for a fixed cell
search the energy landscape is good enough to permit the known Pnnm structure of gamma-B to be rapidly
located. In this case it has been located four times out of 1053 attempts. In a longer run it has been located
113 times in 21,222 attempts, suggesting a mean number of attempts to identify the ground state of 188.
