In this example we will use random searching to find the ground state of Lennard-Jones cluster with 38 atoms, using symmetry.

FIX_ALL_CELL : true

#MINSEP=1.5
#CLUSTER
#POSAMP=3.75
#SYMMOPS=2-5
#NFORM=1

Random clusters will be built containing 38 atoms and with the symmetry of a randomly chosen point group with between 2 and 5 symmetry operations. If "#NFORM=1" is omitted the default behaviour is that the number of atoms in the cluster will be nops x 38, which is unlikely to be satisfied in a sphere of radius 3.75 and minimum separation of 1.5.

The searches can be run in the background and monitored during their progress using the "ca" command.

The above is a summary of the completed run, followed by the top ten (-t) structures. The known Oh ground state of LJ38 is found twice in 200 attempts in this example, and the C5v icosahedral minima is also located. The use of symmetry is highly recommended - compare to the results of example 1.5.
