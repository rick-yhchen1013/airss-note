Here we search for defects by digging a hole in a bulk crystal, and randomising the positions of the atoms in the hole.

It is particularly important to visualise the output of the randomisation phase before optimisation for these more complex geometries.

It appears that a particularly low energy defect has been located which possesses some symmetry. It is clear that the search is not exhaustive, given the lack of low energy repeats.
