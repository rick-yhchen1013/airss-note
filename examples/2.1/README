In this example we will explore the energy landscape of Carbon at 100GPa (or 1MBar). For comparison, the pressure at the centre of the Earth is about 350GPa.

The only AIRSS related command in the cell file is "#MINSEP=1.3". This is not essential for the light elements, but for transition metals it is important to avoid core overlap to prevent poor convergence of the electronic structure. The k-points sampling density is 0.07, with 0.05 more appropriate for metallic (or nearly metallic) systems.

In this very small cell, most of the structures found are the diamond structure (space group Fd-3m). If the search is repeated at lower pressures, for example 1GPa, more graphitic structures will be found.
