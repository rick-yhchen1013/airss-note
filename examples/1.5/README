The relax and shake (RASH) algorithm is a mimimal parameter "learning" algorithm. The first step is a structural optimisation of a random structure - which becomes the current "best" structure. The resulting local minima is "shaken" - a random displacement of amplitude "amp" is applied to all atoms (subject to the minimum separation constraint) and relaxed. This shaking of the best (or most stable) structure is repeated "num" times (after which a new random structure is generated) or until a better structure is found, and then itself shaken up to "num" times.

By default the rejected structures are removed so we are only left with 15 distinct structures. The AIRSS script can be called with the "-track" flag to supress this behaviour.

In the above example, in both random search, and RASH, the known ground state for LJ38 was located - with random search apparently more sucessful. The mean number of attempts until first encounter (Na) is around 10K for random search and 1K for RASH with the parameters used, and due to the exponential probability distribution of such sucess/fail computational experiments the standard deviation is also Na, and hence large. Many runs must be performed before a good estimate of Na is obtainedand reasonable assesment of the relative performance of methods may be made. An advantage of the RASH algorithm is that the structural optimisations following a shake require fewer steps than the relaxtion of a completely random structure. A disadvantage is that the values of "num" and "amp" must be determined - and if "num" is large (so that the search is stuck in unpromising basins) or "amp" is small (so the local minima is never escaped on shaking) Na will tend to infinity. A good recommendation for "amp" is about half a typical bond length. For large systems RASH is a very effective way to obtain "quite a good solution quite quickly".

It is clear, for this problem, the use of symmetry explored in 1.4 is recommended.
