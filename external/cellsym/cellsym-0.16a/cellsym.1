.TH cellsym 1
.SH NAME
cellsym - identifies symmetry operations in cell, shelx or pdb file,

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B cellsym
[-v] [-e=tol] [--OPTIONS] [--FORMAT] infile [outfile]

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B cellsym
is a command-line wrapper for the spglib library for finding symmetry
operations in a crystal. It can read and write (and convert between) cell,
shelx and pdb files.

,LP
Input is assumed to be in the cell format unless the input file name ends
'.pdb' or '.res'.

.SH OPTIONS

.LP
.TP
.B \-e=tol
set tolerance to tol, e.g. 1e-3.
.LP
.TP
.B \-\-int
call spg_get_international(), and print resulting symbol.
.TP
.B \-\-list
call spg_get_symmetry() and list results.
.TP
.B \-\-point
call spg_get_symmetry() followed by spg_get_pointgroup(), and report result.
.TP
.B \-\-primitive
call spg_find_primitive(), and thus find primitive cell.
.TP
.B \-\-refine
call spg_refine_cell(), which adjusts the cell to make it fit exactly with
symmetry found.
.TP
.B \-\-schoen
call spg_get_schoenflies(), and print resulting symbol.
.TP
.B \-\-symmetry
call spg_get_symmetry()

.LP
If multiple operations are specified, the order in which they are called is
primitive, refine, int, schoen, symmetry, list, point.

.SH FORMATS

.TP
.B \-\-cell
CASTEP .cell, cartesian cell, fractional co-ordinates. The output contains
just the lattice and positions blocks, so is not a valid input to CASTEP, but
can easily be made so.
.TP
.B \-\-cell_abc
CASTEP .cell, abc cell, fractional co-ordinates.
.TP
.B \-\-cell_abs
CASTEP .cell, cartesian cell, absolute co-ordinates.
.TP
.B \-\-cell_abc_abs
CASTEP .cell, abc cell, absolute co-ordinates.
.TP
.B \-\-null
Null output. Throw away all output, but still write some useful information
from the input to stderr.
.TP
.B \-\-pdb
PDB
.TP
.B \-\-pdbn
PDB, but label the atoms with element symbol and number within that species,
e.g. C8, H24, Ca2, rather than just with element symbol. The whole string
can contain no more than four characters, so * is used for the numeric part
if it would not otherwise fit.
.TP
.B \-\-shelx
SHELX97

.LP
If
.B \-v
is specified, the cell output will include comments which describe the
symmetry operations.

.SH NOTES

.LP
If no operation is given, the program will simply convert between different
file formats.

.LP
Details of the operation of spglib can be found at
http://spglib.sourceforge.net/ This simple wrapper does not currently give
access to any of the k-point functionality of spglib.

.LP
A symmetry operation of a -2 rotation is, of course, a mirror plane. If there
is a component of the accompanying translation within the plane then it is a
glide plane. The axis given for 1 and -1 rotations is, of course, irrelevant.
